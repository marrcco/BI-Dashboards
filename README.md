# BI-Dashboards
Here you can find examples of BI Dashboards from my previous projects. I've used Google Data Studio and Tableau to build dashboards. Logo of company is hidden because of privacy reasons.
In order to create dashboards I had to use my SQL skills to get the data in the first place.
Data Sources used for these dashboards are: MariaDB, MySql, Heroku, Google Analytics, Google Sheets and Facebook ads.
NOTE: Logos and some pages had to be removed because of the privacy reasons.
